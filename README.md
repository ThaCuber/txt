# txt
a text based game framework, sorta like [cel7](https://rxi.itch.io/cel7) but not quite. it uses [Wren](https://wren.io/), the font is unchangeable and I didn't want to design a palette so you can use rgb (0-255)

## doc

you must make a 'Game' class with a `new` constructor and an `update` method that must also take in a parameter for the delta time.

all of txt's behavior is within the `TXT` foreign class and all position/size related methods are measured in cells

## build

run the `build.bat` file in the root directory

it currently only supports 64-bit windows, I don't know how to compile for other platforms

if you're more of a Makefile person you can also run `mingw32-make`
